**Tagline:** Operational Testbed of Interconnected FLUIDOS Nodes with Live Dashboard

## Overview

FLUIDOS LiveGrid is a real-world, geographically distributed testbed composed of interconnected FLUIDOS nodes and a live monitoring dashboard.

It demonstrates an energy-aware orchestration mechanism that enables:

- Local edge nodes to extend their execution capabilities by leveraging remote cloud clusters.
- A central orchestrator to optimize and coordinate service deployments across edge devices.

This environment showcases real hybrid orchestration in an end-to-end, demonstrable setup.
